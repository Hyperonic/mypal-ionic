            <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is this an official myki app?</strong>
                    <br>No.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Does this app top up faster than the myki website?</strong>
                    <br>No. This app uses the same top up functionality as the myki website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why is my balance or transactions inaccurate?</strong>
                    <br>The app uses the data provided by the myki website which is usually delayed by 12 hours, up to 24 hours.
                    <br>
                    <br>The myki website is known to have issues with some transaction records such as missing cost details for some touch-offs, this may cause the app to inaccurately show myki pass transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What are the weird names in my touch-on and touch-off history?</strong>
                    <br>The myki has poor formatting for bus and tram stops. Unfortunately I'm too lazy to correct them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Can this app send me push notifications when my balance is low or pass is about to expire?</strong>
                    <br>Unfortunately the app does not send push notifications because it would have required storing your myki account login information on a server, and I don't want to do that.
                    <br>
                    <br>You can add a calendar reminder for when your pass expires by tapping on the alarm button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are you stealing my myki information?</strong>
                    <br>Myki information is only sent to the myki website and stored on the device for automatic log-in. No myki information is sent or stored on any other servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Are you stealing my credit card information?</strong>
                    <br> Credit card information is only sent to the myki website and is not stored.
                    <br>
                    <br>If you are tech savvy, you can audit the network traffic with a proxy or <a href="https://github.com/longzheng/mypal-ionic/">audit the source code here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>I am encountering a problem or bug, how do I get help?</strong>
                    <br>Create a "<a href="https://github.com/longzheng/mypal-ionic/issues">new issue</a>" on Github.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Who made this and why?</strong>
                    <br>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/longzheng">Long Zheng</a> and I'm a software designer &amp; developer in Melbourne.
                    <br>
                    <br>I use myki everyday but the myki website is extremely cumbersome, especially on mobile. I was eager
                    to learn the new mobile development tool Ionic2 and I thought it might be useful to make a better experience
                    for myki on mobile.
                    <br>
                    <br>I want to make myki great again.
